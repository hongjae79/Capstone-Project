Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. It would be interesting research to find the best fitting model to predict concrete compressive strength from given data. The data is Concrete Compressive Strength Data Set from UCI machine learning depository. It has 1030 instances and 9 attributes.

Student performance depends on many factors. Student Performance Data Set in UCI machine learning depository has 649 instances and attributes. This data is from two Portuguese schools about student performance in secondary school. It will be a intersting research to know what type of factors would be critical on future success of students.

Congressional Voting Records Data Set in UCI machine learnining depository shows votes for each of the U.S. House of Representatives Congressmen on the 16 key votes identified by the CQA in 1984.
