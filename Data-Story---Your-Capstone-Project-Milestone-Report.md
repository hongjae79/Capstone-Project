We find the best fit model for concrete compressive strength from given inputs: cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function. We run 5 different models: Linear Regression, Penalized Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, CART, and Support Vector Machines with Linear Kernel. With the best fit model, we predict a concrete compressive strength within close confidence interval.
