Capstone-Project-Proposal

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. It would be interesting research to find the best fitting model to predict concrete compressive strength from given data. The data is Concrete Compressive Strength Data Set from UCI machine learning depository. It has 1030 instances and 9 attributes.
